        <h2> What is a Electric?</h2>
    <p>
        Troubleshooting electrical things is surprisingly easy. Once you understand the device’s as-designed state you
        can define the problem and start looking for a solution. For example, a cord either delivers electricity to the
        device or it doesn’t. An electrical switch is on, off, or, in variable switches, at some value in between. A
        heating element either heats or it doesn’t. By thinking of electrical devices as components that have specific
        jobs — pass electricity, stop electricity, produce heat, turn a blade, etc. — you can more easily figure out
        what’s wrong and what to do about it.

        There’s one more electrical term you’ve probably heard. Defining it will come in handy as you fix electrical
        devices. A watt is the amount of power consumed by an electrical device when it is running. A 750-watt toaster,
        for example, uses 750W (watts) of power when toasting your wheat, rye, sourdough, or other bread in the morning.
